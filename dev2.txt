## inspiring
When I wanted to continue the song I had made a long time ago and left half done, I saw that I needed more tools.
It was a long time ago and my mood had changed. I needed to follow the original pattern and that was the problem.
At the same time, I was working on a platform to build a program and I wanted to use machine learning on this platform
That's why I created a new algorithm to both use my tutorials and help build and adjust my music.
## what is he doing?
In fact, the software examines the music mode and learns a pattern from it, and then guesses the harmony and counterpoint of the piece. If it is correct, the pattern is amplified, otherwise it learns a new way of composing.
In this way, the more the composer uses the software, the better the machine learns to recognize what suggestions to make and the easier it becomes.
## How I made it
I used to work on a programming platform and I am still developing it
In this platform, you can design the software and develop it from within
Another part of this platform that needs to be designed and added is the tuning of machine learning algorithms
With this mode, anyone can quickly connect their desired algorithm to their program
It also makes it easier to add menus to the application database pages and connect them all together
I designed an algorithm and created the database and put it on the platform
## Challenges I ran
Of course, I have to admit that I did it alone, and because I was working on two things at the same time, both the platform and the algorithm, it was very difficult for me to do what a team actually had to do.
It is also difficult for me to design the net section because I have to spend a lot of time designing that section
## Where am I now?
It is currently taking the information and separating it and sending it to the database and you can see what is important is working on this data.
And this is where machine learning begins
## Made with
This platform is made with Python and WX graphics and SQL light database.
In music, it opens XML files and uses the Python Music 21 module
##In the following
Yes, this software can be expanded
The music section should be added separately, which is very useful
The algorithm can be changed according to the composer's taste and the parameters used can be increased or decreased
And ...
I hope that with your support, the platform will develop and help the composer become better and more advanced
Thank you
